## Project Title:
Bioacoustic Animal Identification

## Project Description:
We are going to create a system that can identify local wildlife based on their vocal calls using TinyML on a microcontroller


## Key Objectives:
- Determine ideal hardware, determine ML network structure. 
- Determine classification categories and train network. 
- Use the deployed hardware with the trained network to correctly identify animals based on their calls. 

## Technology Stack:
- PLatform: TinyML 
- Software Tools: C/C++
- Hardware Tools: Syntiant TinyML

## Expected Outcomes:
- By the end of the semester we will have a working model that can listen to an animal sound and correctly identify that sound with at least 80% accuracy. We will have a model that has been trained to correctly identify these sounds for a number of animals common around Charlottesville. 

## Timeline:
(Provide a rough timeline or milestones for the project)
 - By 11/8: Select hardware
 - By 11/15: Choose classifications
 - By 11/22: Choose network structure
 - By 11/29: Have network trained
 - By 12/6: Successful test of deployed network
