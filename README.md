## Project Title:
Bioacoustic Animal Identification

## Project Description:
We are going to create a system that can identify local wildlife based on their vocal calls using TinyML on a microcontroller


## Key Objectives:
- Determine ideal hardware, determine ML network structure. 
- Determine classification categories and train network. 
- Use the deployed hardware with the trained network to correctly identify animals based on their calls. 

## Technology Stack:
PLatform: TinyML 
Software Tools: C/C++
Hardware Tools: Syntiant TinyML

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)
We expect to deliver a working model by the end of the semester that can correctly classify the bird call at least 80% of the time (given an ideal audio input)

## Timeline:
(Provide a rough timeline or milestones for the project)
