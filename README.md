## Project Title:
Bioacoustic Bird Identification

## Project Description:
(Provide a short description of the problem you're addressing)
Identify local birds based on their calls using TinyML on a microcontroller


## Key Objectives:
- Determine ideal hardware, determine ML network structure. 
- Determine classification categories and train network. 
- Use the deployed hardware with the trained network to correctly identify birds based on their calls. 

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)
TinyML - C/C++ ??
Decide on hardware

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)
We expect to deliver a working model by the end of the semester that can correctly classify the bird call at least 80% of the time (given an ideal audio input)

## Timeline:
(Provide a rough timeline or milestones for the project)
