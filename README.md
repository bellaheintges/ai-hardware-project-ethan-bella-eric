# AI Hardware Project Proposal
### ECE 4501 - Fall 2024

## Team Name: 
### 4501_project_group 2

## Team Members:
- Ethan Jenkins
- Bella Heintges
- Eric Sheetz

## Project Title:
Bioacoustic Animal Identification

## Project Description:
- We plan to design a compact system capable of identifying local wildlife species by recognizing their vocal calls by leveraging the power of TinyML. This system will be deployed on a microcontroller specifically chosen for its capability to record and process audio data in real-time. By analyzing the audio inputs, our system will be able to detect and classify animal sounds, allowing for efficient and on-site wildlife monitoring.

## Key Objectives:
- Determine ideal hardware, determine ML network structure. 
- Determine classification categories and train network. 
- Use the deployed hardware with the trained network to correctly identify animals based on their calls. 

## Technology Stack:
- Platform: TinyML 
- Software Tools: C/C++
- Hardware Tools: Syntiant TinyML

## Expected Outcomes:
- By the end of the semester we will have a working model that can listen to an animal sound and correctly identify that sound with at least 80% accuracy. We will have a model that has been trained to correctly identify these sounds for a number of animals common around Charlottesville. 

## Timeline:
 - By 11/8: Select hardware
 - By 11/15: Choose classifications
 - By 11/22: Choose network structure
 - By 11/29: Have network trained
 - By 12/6: Successful test of deployed network
